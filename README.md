# "Toy Models of Superposition" replication

This is a replication of the Anthropic paper ["Toy Models of Superposition"](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html) by Elhage et al. (2022). So far, I have trained and visualized ReLU models whose weights illustrate a phase transition in superposition. See the [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OMsbf2m0tRwQrog5nb3qmdet58RHNif3?usp=sharing).

To do:

- [ ] Train models and produce plots to [demonstrate superposition](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html#demonstrating).
- [ ] (Tentative) Replicate the sections on [feature geometry](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html#geometry) and [computation in superposition](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html#computation).
